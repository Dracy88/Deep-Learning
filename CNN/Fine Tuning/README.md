# Flowers Recognitor

Using a pretrained CNN, we can use the Fine tune techniques to correct classify 102 types of flowers starting from an image.
With the Data augmentation and Transfer learning we can also avoid the problem to have a small dataset.

The dataset is available on Deep-Learning/CNN/Flowers_dataset.zip
