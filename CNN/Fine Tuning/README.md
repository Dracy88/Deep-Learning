# Flowers Recognitor

Using a pretrained CNN, we can use the Fine tune techniques to correct classify 102 types of flowers starting from an image.
With the Data augmentation and Transfer learning we will avoid the problem to have a small dataset.

For the Hyper-parameter search we can use the Bayesian optimization, in order to find the best parameters automatically.
