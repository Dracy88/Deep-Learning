# Deep-Learning
Some projects of Deep Learning:
- Default Payments Predictor: using a neural network, we can predict if a client will go on default on his credit card.
- Animal Recognizer: using the CNN, we can classify an animal image as a chicken, cow or sheep
- Digit Recognizer: using the CNN, we can classify the digit of the Mnist dataset
- Digit Recognizer 2: using the autoencoders, we can reduce the number of feature and use a classic DNN to train a digit classifier
- Flower Recognizer: using the CNN and the Transfer learning technique, we can classify 102 types of flower
- Flower Recognizer 2: using the CNN and the Fine Tuning technique, we can classify 102 types of flower
- RNN (Coming soon..)
- Speech Recognizer: converting audio files into text (Planned)
